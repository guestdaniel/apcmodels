**Description**: The present implementation of the Zilany, Bruce, and Carney (2014) auditory nerve model is based on modified copies of source code originally written by Marek Rudnicki and colleagues that is available in the [`cochlea`](https://github.com/mrkrd/cochlea) package. 

**Changes**: A subset of the authors' `cochlea/cochlea/zilany2014` submodule was modified and included in `apcmodels` in March 2020. `.c` and `.pyx` files were largely untouched, while code from `.py` files was refactored into `run_zilany.py`.

**Location**: `apcmodels/external/zilany2014`.
