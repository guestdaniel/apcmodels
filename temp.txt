### Heinz, Colburn, and Carney (2001)

The Heinz et al. (2001) model simulates the instantaneous firing rate of HSR auditory nerve fibers. The model as specified in the corresponding paper has been implemented entirely in Python. The auditory nerve stage of the model has been implemented in Numba to improve computation time.

### Zilany, Bruce, and Carney (2014)

The Zilany et al. (2014) model simulates the instantaneous firing rate of LSR, MSR, and HSR auditory nerve fibers. The model is originally implemented in C, and the [`cochlea`](https://github.com/mrkrd/cochlea) package provides a Python interface to a slightly modified version of that C implementation (the changes are supposed to consist only of removal of `.mex`-specific parts of the C code). We have in turn included a number of files from [`cochlea`](https://github.com/mrkrd/cochlea) package in `external` so that their version of the Zilany et al. (2014) model can be accessed through `apcmodels` without the need to install [`cochlea`](https://github.com/mrkrd/cochlea). The Python interface depends on `Cython` and requires a working C compiler. In theory, installing `apcmodels` should automatically handle the compilation process behind the scenes for you. If this does not work, you may want to try running `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` in the home directory of `apcmodels`, which should run `cythonize()` on the necessary files in `external/zilany2014`.

### Verhulst, Altoe, and Vasilkov (2018)

The Verhulst et al. (2018) model simulates basilar membrane responses using a transmission line model as well as inner hair cell responses and HSR, MSR, and LSR auditory nerve instantaneous firing rates.
