`apcmodels` is a Python library to implement computational models of the auditory system, simulate responses for these models to a range of stimuli used in psychophysical experiments, and analyze the outputs of these models. `apcmodels` utilizes code from a range of existing Python packages in the auditory modeling domain and provides a single unified API to access these models.
